Introduction
============

With this extension we decided to fill a gap of social media integration in typo3. Our goal is it to provide an easy
and time-saving way of integrating and interacting with common social media platforms. As you know nothing is perfect
but we will give our best to make this extension as comfortable as you need it. For this we need your feedback, so
if you need anything or have something to say, don't hesitate to contact us. Simply write an email to info@plusb.de.

Please visit the plugin homepage http://plusb.de/log/social-media-streams-pb_social/

may the Force be with you


.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

It can display feeds from social media platforms in the way you like it. Maybe you want to get your
Facebook-Page content? No problem, set your Facebook-Credentials and Facebook-UserId and you're ready to go.
The Extension will do all the tricky authentication stuff and leave the relaxed part of making the result pretty to you.

Sometimes you'll need to follow a link to generate access codes for our plugin. Be sure that we don't have access to any
of your sensitive data. Everything is stored in your Typo3 database! The reason why you need to provide these access codes
is that some social media platforms recently strated to use OAuth 2 authentication.

.. _good-to-know:

Good to know
------------

1. Likes and comments of Facebook posts are limited to 70. Posts with more than 70 likes/comments are marked as 70+.
2. Instagram can still be used, even if your app is in sandbox mode! You just have to send a sandbox invite to the user whose posts you want to show.
3. Google+ search IDs and vimeo channel IDs do not necessarily have to be a numeric value.
4. Tumblr posts can only be filtered by one of the first five tags, because only the first 5 of your tags are searchable on Tumblr.
